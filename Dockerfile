# Dockerfile

FROM ruby:3.2.2
## This pulls the official Ruby 3.2.2 image from Docker Hub (Docker Hub),
## which includes Ruby and a Debian-based Linux environment.
## This is the foundation for the container, ensuring compatibility with the RoR applica                                                                                                tion.

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

## Sets the working directory inside the container to /app,
## where all subsequent commands will execute.
## This is where the application code will reside,
## following best practices for organization.

# Install packages
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs curl redis

## Updates the package list quietly (-qq) and installs essential packages:
### build-essential: Provides compilers and libraries (e.g., gcc, make) needed for building software.
### libpq-dev: Development files for PostgreSQL, required for the pg gem used in Rails for database connectivity.
### nodejs: JavaScript runtime, necessary for asset compilation (e.g., Webpacker or Sprockets).
### curl: A tool for transferring data, used here for installing additional tools like Yarn.
## redis: Installs the Redis server, likely used for caching or real-time features like ActionCable.
## This step ensures the container has all system-level dependencies for the RoR app.

# Install Yarn
RUN curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add - \
  && echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list \
  && apt-get update && apt-get install -y yarn

## Installs Yarn, a package manager for JavaScript, which is often used in Rails for managing frontend dependencies:
### First, adds the Yarn GPG key for secure package verification.
### Adds the Yarn repository to the sources list.
### Updates the package list and installs Yarn.
## This is crucial for applications using JavaScript frameworks or asset pipelines.

# Install bundler
RUN gem install bundler

## Installs Bundler, the Ruby dependency manager,
## which reads the Gemfile to install gems.
## This ensures the RoR application has all required Ruby libraries.

# Copy Gemfiles and install dependencies
COPY Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install

## Copies the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to the container,
## then runs bundle install to install the gems specified.
## This step is done early to leverage Docker layer caching,
## improving build times if the Gemfile doesn't change.

# Copy rest of the application
COPY . .
## Copies the entire application code from the host to the container's /app directory.
## This includes all source files, configurations, and assets.

# Ensure tmp directories exist
RUN mkdir -p tmp/pids tmp/cache tmp/sockets log
## Creates directories for temporary files, cache, sockets, and logs.
## The -p flag ensures parent directories are created if they don't exist,
## preventing errors. These directories are standard for Rails applications,
## used by Puma and other processes.


# Precompile assets (optional for production)
RUN bundle exec rake assets:precompile

## Precompiles assets (CSS, JavaScript) for production using the rake
## assets:precompile task. This step is optional but recommended for production
## to improve performance by serving precompiled assets, reducing server load.

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 3000

## Informs Docker that the container listens on port 3000 at runtime.
## This is the default port for Rails applications using Puma,
## making it accessible externally when mapped.

# Start the app with Puma
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "puma", "-C", "config/puma.rb"]

## Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
## It uses Bundler to execute Puma, the web server for Rails,
## with the configuration file config/puma.rb.
## This starts the application, listening on port 3000.
